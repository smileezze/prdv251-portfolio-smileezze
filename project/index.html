<h2>My Mission in Life</h2>
    <p>Coding creative side projects, crafting the perfect mocha as a barista, and chasing the ultimate chocolate bar—one pixel, one cocoa percentage, and one retro Game Boy at a time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Obsessively curates a personal collection of single-origin dark chocolate bars, complete with detailed tasting notes on origins, flavor profiles, and ethical sourcing (he's currently hunting for the perfect 80%+ bar with bright fruit notes).</li>
      <li>Restores and mods vintage Game Boys in his spare time, turning scratched relics into custom beauties with fresh screens, buttons, and even themed shells inspired by his favorite chocolate aesthetics.</li>
      <li>Master intricate latte art at the coffee shop using cocoa powder stencils, often turning mochas into edible masterpieces like hearts, ferns, or tiny pixelated designs that surprise regular customers.</li>
    </ul>
